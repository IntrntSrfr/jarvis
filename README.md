This is simply me trying to learn about machine learning. It has some stuff for a perceptron as well as a 
3 layer neural network. The network is able to solve the xor-problem with like 99.9% accuracy (amazing, right), as
well as I used it to enter the digit recognition competition on kaggle, and it got a 97% accuracy with about 200 
epochs.
